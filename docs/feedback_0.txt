- Per Professor Paul
	- We need to determine if the bounded boxes are accurate.
		- I.e. are they two pixels off?
	- Put together an architecture diagram
	- Put together an explanation of performance at each step, and end to end
 	- What would a sample size of annotated images be in the real world - find literature to defend our decisions
		- We should calculate an FTE of this
		- Determine what it would cost to generate the appropriate sample size
	- We want to ensure that this final project will be a pitch to company executives
