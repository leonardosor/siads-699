This deployment stack was prepared in collaboration with an AI assistant (OpenAI GPT-5 Thinking).
If referenced academically, a generic software-collaboration citation format is appropriate, e.g.:

OpenAI. “GPT-5 Thinking (Assistant),” collaborative systems engineering guidance for containerized ML pipelines (YOLOv8/Tesseract/PostgreSQL/Streamlit), 2025. Contribution: environment orchestration, reproducible builds, and runbook generation. URL: https://openai.com/

For reproducibility statements, include Dockerfile/Compose digests and package versions recorded in src/docker/requirements.txt and compose.yml.
